"""
Router Package - Seed Template

This package contains FastAPI routers for API endpoints.
Derek will add router modules here (e.g., products.py, tasks.py, notes.py).

The System Integrator automatically discovers and wires routers from this directory.

# Router modules will be added by Derek during backend_implementation step
# Example after Derek generates a products router:
# from . import products
