NO CHANGES

🚀 Quick Start (Standard Apps)

Modern Notes App
"Create a notes manager where users can create, edit, delete, and search notes by title. Use a grid layout with cards for the notes and a dark mode UI."

Minimalist Todo List
"Build a clean, modern todo app. Features should include adding tasks, marking them as completed, deleting tasks, and filtering by status (All, Active, Completed)."

Bug Tracker Dashboard
"Build a bug tracking system with features to create reports, update status (Open, In Progress, Resolved), assign priority, and add comments. Include a dashboard overview page."

Personal Finance Dashboard
"Create a personal finance tracker where users can add expenses, assign categories, and view monthly totals. Include a dashboard with simple charts visualizing spending by category."

Ticketing System
Build a customer support ticketing tool with: dashboard stats, ticket list, filters by status/priority, and a detailed ticket view page.

Advanced (Showcase "Refine Mode")
Self-Healing CI/CD Monitor
"Build a dashboard that connects to GitHub Actions logs. When a build fails, I want an agent to analyze the error log and propose a code fix automatically."
(Refinement Idea: "Now make it send the fix as a Pull Request.")

Conversational SQL Admin
"Create a tool where I can chat with my database in plain English. For example, 'Show me the top 5 users by spend'. The system should generate and run the SQL."
(Refinement Idea: "Now group the results by city.")

API from JSON (Mock-to-Real)
"I will upload a JSON file with sample data. Build a fully functional FastAPI backend that serves this data with proper CRUD endpoints."
(Refinement Idea: "Add JWT authentication to the POST endpoints.")

AI Ghost Blogger
"Build a blog platform where the 'Admin' is an AI. If I upload a text file with bullet points, the system should automatically write a full article and publish it."
(Refinement Idea: "Change the writing tone to be more sarcastic.")
